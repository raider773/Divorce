# Divorce
Predicting if you are going to divorce!


In this project i try to predict if a person is gonna divorce or not depending on the answers given to certain questions.\
The questions are in attributes.txt. \
The answers are numbers from 0 to 4, the last agreeing the most with the question. \
I did some reduction dimnesionality to graph the classes, as well as trying some models and analysing them. \
Finally i deploy the model in flask, and created a function where you answer the questions and the model predicts if you are gonna divorce or not.

I used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to plot both classes.\
From this i assume the binary classification can be done with a plane, so im gonna use models that classify based on this. \
We can also see the classes are quite separated from each other.

--------------------------

I trained three models. A logistic regression and an LDA, models that separate classes linearly, and a KNN. Since in the PCA graph the classes appeared clearly separated i
could assume the features in a hyperplane look somewhat similar. The KNN would perform quite ok.

Knn scores and best parameters of the GridSearch

-------------------------

I compared the models and end up using the LDA.
I used Lime library to analyse how much features weight in a prediction.

I ended up with questions 18, 48, 15 and 54 affecting most of the predictions:

15. Our dreams with my spouse are similar and harmonious.
18. My spouse and I have similar ideas about how marriage should be
48. I feel right in our discussions.
54. I'm not afraid to tell my spouse about her/his incompetence.

Importance of features in a specific prediction. 18, 48, 15 and 54 appearing in a lot of random selected samples fro prediction

-----------------------------

Finally i used Flask for deployment and created a simple function to evaluate teh statements and recieve the model prediction.
