Predicting if you are going to divorce!


In this project i try to predict if a person is gonna divorce or not depending on the answers given to certain questions.\
The questiosn are in attributes.txt. \
The answers are numbers from 0 to 4, the last agreeing the most with the question. \
I did some reduction dimnesionality to graph the classes, as well as trying some models and analysing them. \
Finally i deploy the model in flask, and created a function where you answer the questions and the model predicts if you are gonna divorce or not. \
